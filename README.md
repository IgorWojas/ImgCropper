# ImgCropper
A simple tool to crop images in bulk. Made to prepare datasets for NN training

1. Put images you want to crop into the "in" folder (.jpg .jpeg .bmp .png)
2. Run the program
3. x1 y1 - Coordinates of the begin pixel
4. x2 y2 - Coordinates of the end pixel
5. The program draws a rectangle from begin pixel to end pixel, crops the content from inside the rectangle and saves cropped images in the "out" folder as .bmp
6. Happy days ;)
